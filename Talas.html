           <p>Talas is a small but famous city, and the administrative center of Talas Province. Located in the western corner of Kyrgyzstan, Talas is separated from the country by a chain of mountains, but can be reached by crossing the Teo-Ashuu Pass. Talas Province is famous as the probable birthplace of the legendary hero Manas and of Kyrgyzstanâ€™s most famous writer, Chingiz Aitmatov.</p> <br>
           <p>Talas's biggest impact on world history is perhaps the Battle of Talas, in 751. This battle marked the one time that Arab forces (in this case, the Abbasid Caliphate) fought Chinese forces (the Tang Dynasty). The Chinese has been expanding westward aggressively, gaining control of Kabul and Kashmir. The Abbasids started to push back, and the two armies met on the banks of the Talas River in 751, resulting in a decisive Arab victory. After this victory, Islam became the dominant religion in Central Asia, rather than Buddhism, and the secrets of papermaking were shared outside of China for the first time by Chinese prisoners of war held in Central Asia.</p> <br>
