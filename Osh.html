           <p>Osh is one of the oldest cities in Central Asia, a city where you can experience the real oriental flavor and come in contact with two very different and neighboring cultures: the Kyrgyz nomadic culture and the sedentary agricultural culture of the Fergana Valley.</p> <br>
           <p>All historical significance of Osh is concentrated in the Sulaiman-Too mountain, around which this ancient city is located. Her name is associated with the name of the legendary prophet and King Solomon, who according to the traditions prayed on the top of this mountain. The mosque on the summit of Sulaiman-Too, is built by the great Babur, the founder of the empire of the Great Moguls. At the foot of the mountain there is a large number of historical buildings: medieval mosques and mausoleums, and in the caves of the mountain itself there is a unique historical museum built in the Soviet years. Sulaiman-Too is the most important Muslim shrine, located in Central Asia.
            For many centuries Osh was an important part of the great Silk Road, and therefore another amazing side of the city is the famous Osh bazaar, which has existed for more than two thousand years and is located on the two sides of the Ak Buura River. There has always been a thriving trade and even now you can see the unique spirit of the oriental bazaar with your eyes, which is considered the most authentic bazaar in Central Asia. There is also a museum in Osh dedicated to the city and the Great Silk Road, in which this city played a significant role.</p> <br>
